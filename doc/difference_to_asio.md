# Difference to Asio

The free functions in this library (except `agrpc::repeatedly_request`) require that the completion handler's executor be created from a `agrpc::GrpcExecutor` and they use that as the I/O executor. Unlike Asio, where the I/O executor is obtained from the first argument to the initiating function. Example:

```cpp
asio::steady_timer timer{exec1}; // exec1 is the I/O executor
timer.async_wait(asio::bind_executor(exec2, [](auto&&) {})); // exec2 is the completion handler executor
```

In asio-grpc:

```cpp
grpc::Alarm alarm;
agrpc::wait(alarm, deadline, asio::bind_executor(grpc_context.get_executor(), [](auto&&) {}));
// grpc_context.get_executor() is both, the I/O executor and completion handler executor
```

As a consequence, the asynchronous operations always complete in the thread that called `GrpcContext::run*()/poll*()`, whereas Asio would submit the completion handler for execution as if by performing `asio::dispatch(exec2, [=<moved>]() { completion_handler(args...); })`. See also [Asio's documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/asynchronous_operations.html).

All classes documented as "I/O object" in asio-grpc behave more closely to Asio and perform the dispatch and do not require the completion handler's executor be created from a `agrpc::GrpcExecutor`.

-------

Until asio-grpc v2.0.0 the completion handler's allocator was retrieved in a manner equivalent to:

```cpp
asio::get_associated_allocator(completion_handler, asio::query(asio::get_associated_executor(completion_handler), asio::execution::allocator));
```

Since v2.0.0 the allocator is retrieved using:

```cpp
asio::get_associated_allocator(completion_handler);
```

which is equivalent to Asio.
